# Statistical Inference with R
### Skills: Statistical Inference, R, ggplot

Some questions might seem silly or trivial. Does a hurricane's name influence it's strength? It seems obvious that this can not be the case, but data might seem to indicate the opposite at first glance. Using robust statistical tests and inference, some sense can be made of these rather silly questions.

Cody_Harris_stat.pdf contains a report that consists of question prompts, and my answers to those questions along with the R code needed to visualize or analyze the data. This is the only file that you can directly read the report on Github.

Cody_Harris_stat.html is the best version of the file to read the report, but you need to download it and open it with a web broswer.

Cody_Harris_stat.rmd is the source code. For this file to correctly function, please download the img folder and put it in the same directory as the rmd folder. Also the data files need to be downloaded and placed in the same folder as well.
